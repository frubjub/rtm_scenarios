##	Weighting functions for other parameters
##        ANPS => average number of photon scattering events
##        Elev => surface elevation
##        TH   => tangent height
Other parameters - weighting functions

##      If RTM Mode is set to 'wf' or 'ret' the weighting functions can be
##      calculated for relative 'rel' or absolute 'abs' variation of the
##      all atmospheric parameters.
Absolute or relative WF
abs

##      If RTM Mode is set to "wf" and RTM-CORE to "DOM"
##      than weighting functions can be integrated over each layer
##      analytically ("analytic"), numerically ("numeric") or calculated
##      without integration ("nointegr")
WF integration mode
numeric

##      Normalization of the weighting functions
##      (has only an effect RTM Mode is set to "wf" and RTM-CORE to "DOM")
##      1) 'standard' - the weighting functions refer to a change of an
##                      atmospheric parameter within altitude layers
##                      defined by the input grid
##      2) 'unified'  - the weighting functions are normalized to the
##                      vertical extension of the corresponding altitude
##                      level, i.e., they refer to a change of an
##                      atmospheric parameter within 1 km altitude layers
WF normalization
standard

##      ***** Only relevant if "RTM Mode" is set to 'num_pert' *******
##      Lower and upper boundaries [km] of the altitude range where
##      the weighting function will be calculated
