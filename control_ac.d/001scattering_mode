#*************************************************************************
## 	Selection of scattering mode:
##
##	1) 'ms'       - fully multiple scattering treatment
##      2) 'ss'       - single scattering mode (in non-spherical
##	                modes except for "RTM-CORE" set to "CDI":
##                      only implemented for satellite geometry,
##                      no flux calculations)
##                      (only for HG type of aerosol phase functions)
##                      (at present, in cloud free atmosphere only)
##      3) 'wf_ss'    - single scattering weighting functions, fully
##                      multiple scatterig treatment for intensities
##	                (implemented in spherical mode only, has no
##                       effect in pseuo-spherical mode)
##	4) 'ss_ms' -    single scattering mode for both intensities and
##                      weighting functions at wavelengths shorter than
##	                "SS/MS wavelength boundary", and fully multiple
##                      scattering treatment at longer wavelengths
##	                (in non-spherical modes except for "RTM-CORE"
##	                set to "CDI": only implemented for satellite
##                      geometry, no flux calculations)
##                      (at present, in cloud free atmosphere only)
##                      (only for HG type of aerosol phase functions)
##	5) 'wf_ss_ms' - single scattering mode weighting functions at
##                      wavelengths shorter than
##	                "SS/MS wavelength boundary", and fully multiple
##                      scattering treatment at longer wavelengths,
##                      fully multiple scatterig treatment for intensities)
##	                (implemented in spherical mode only, has no
##                       effect in pseuo-spherical mode)
##	6) 'sm_wf_ss' - 'ss_ms' mode for the intensity and 'wf_ss' mode
##                      for the weighting functions (see descriptions of 
##                      the modes for restrictions)

## Note: surface reflection is not considered in the single scattering mode
